# Py-Port-Scanner

This is a simple Python script for scanning open ports on a target host. It utilizes the `socket` module to establish TCP/IP connections and determine if a specific port is open or closed(work in progress).

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python3x installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/Arjun4522/Py-Port-Scanner` or download the `scanner.py` file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory `cd py-Port-Scanner` containing the `scanner.py` file.

4. Run the script with the following command: `python3 scanner.py <IP>`

5. The script will start scanning the target for open ports in the range of 1 to 1000 (range is editable in source code).

6. Once the scan is complete, the script will display the open ports (if any) along with their corresponding service names.
